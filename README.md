Inspiration and/or explain the app (1-3 lines) - Inspiration was an ecommerce site, as a major part of our future roles could be developing eccommerce sites for clients. We decided on fashion as this is a major industry and we haven't seen this concept out there at all. So this is a unique concept. This app allows you to take photos of clothes in your closet and the app randomly assigns different outfits based on the images uploaded. As a bonus we may want to add an animation and 3D style image of the outfits so they look better, especially if these photos are taken in bad lighting or images may not be straight etc. 
How to use the app - To use the app you would 1 - create items - upload the images of the different clothes (Total 10 images), view items - , create outfits and view outfits -
